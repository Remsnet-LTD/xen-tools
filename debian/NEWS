xen-tools (4.2~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  If the DomU hangs with "Waiting for root file system" despite
  /dev/xvd* is used as disk device, adding "xen-blkfront" to
  /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and runing "update-initramfs -u"
  afterwards may help.

  If the Dom0 is a Debian or Ubuntu, the distribution and suite for
  DomUs defaults to the distribution and suite the Dom0 is
  running. Otherwise Debian DomUs get "stable" and Ubuntu "lucid" by
  default.

  Default Debian/Ubuntu mirror is now determined by looking into
  /etc/apt/sources.list (if it exists) and taking the first entry with
  path ending in /debian/ there.
