xen-tools (4.2~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * If the Dom0 is a Debian or Ubuntu, the distribution and suite for
    DomUs defaults to the distribution and suite the Dom0 is
    running. Otherwise Debian DomUs get "stable" and Ubuntu "lucid" by
    default.

  * Default Debian/Ubuntu mirror is now determined by looking into
    /etc/apt/sources.list (if it exists) and taking the first entry with
    path ending in /debian/ there.
