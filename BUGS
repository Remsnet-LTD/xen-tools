Reporting Bugs
--------------

  To report a bug please use the xen-tools mailing list:

        http://xen-tools.org/software/xen-tools/lists.html

  If you're capable of fixing it yourself a patch is appreciated,
 and a test case would be a useful bonus.


Known Bugs
----------

  The Debian bug tracker contains a list of all currently
 open issues which have been reported by the users of the Debian
 package (the primary user-base):

        http://bugs.debian.org/xen-tools

  If you're running the code on a Debian host system then reporting
 bugs against this package is a good thing to do; by doing so you
 allow others to view issues, and I check the bug-page regularly.
