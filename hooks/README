hooks/


  Once a distribution of GNU/Linux has been installed with xt-install-image
 we'll have a pristine, unconfigured, installation.

  To configure this the program xt-customize-image will call a collection
 of distro-specific shell scripts.

  These scripts are called hooks.  For each distribution we support there
 is a subdirectory containing the necessary functions to configure the
 host minimally.

  By the time the scripts finish we'll expect:

	* The installation to have a working fstab file.
	* The installation will have IP address + networking configured.
	* The installation will have a running installation of OpenSSH

  These subdirectories will be installed to the directory
 /usr/lib/xen-tools/
