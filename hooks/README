hooks/


  Once a distribution of GNU/Linux has been installed by the
 xt-install-image script we'll have a pristine system.

  To configure this the program xt-customize-image will call
 a collection of distro-specific shell scripts, or hooks.

  For each distribution we support there is a subdirectory 
 containing the necessary functions to configure the host
 minimally.

  By the time the scripts finish we'll expect:

   * The installation to have a working fstab file.
   * The installation will have IP address + networking configured.
   * The installation will have a running installation of OpenSSH

  The subdirectories in this hooks/ directory will be installed
 to the directory /usr/share/xen-tools/
