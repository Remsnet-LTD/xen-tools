Mailing List
------------

  For assistance on using, or customising, these scripts please
 consult the manpages initially, then the website:
 
        http://xen-tools.org/software/xen-tools/

  If these are not sufficient resources please consider posting
 to the mailing list:

        http://xen-tools.org/software/xen-tools/lists.html

  Included with the release you should find the file "BUGS" which
 contains some notes on reporting bugs.


Xen Queries
-----------

  If your query is mostly related to Xen, rather than these tools,
 then please consider joining the xen-users mailing list:

        http://lists.xensource.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/xen-users

  The members of that list are very good at diagnosing issues with
 networking, block devices, and other Xen oddities.



Contact The Author
------------------

  As a last resort feel free to contact the author at <steve@steve.org.uk>.

  I say last resort not because I'm unwilling to help, but because
 it will take longer for me to respond to you personally.
