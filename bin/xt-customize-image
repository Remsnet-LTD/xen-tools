#
#  Customize an installed copy of Linux by running hooks, etc.
#

use strict;


#
#  Parse arguments.
#
#  We'll need at least:
#
#    --location = /tmp/3980fdf890
#    --dist     = { sid sarge etch centos4 gentoo .. etc }
#
#



#
#  Check arguments:
#
#   Distro hook directory must exist: /usr/lib/${distro}.d/
#
#   Mountpoint must exist: ${location}


#
#  Run each relevent hook script.
#
# NOTE: Must change to the directory of the scripts prior to running them
#       so that ../common.sh exists and is accessible.
#
#


#  Exit cleanly
#
