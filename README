xen-create-image
----------------

  This is a simple script which is designed to create new images of 
 Debian Sarge which may be used with the Xen virtual machine.



xen-clone-image
---------------

  This allows a simple cloning operation to be conducted.  An existing
 image will be copied to a new directory and the networking information
 will be updated.  No other changes are applied.



xen-delete-image
----------------

  This script will delete an image by hostname.



xen-list-images
---------------

  List all the created images, along with the network address.
 (Or just 'DHCP' for dynamically configured images.)



xen-update-image
----------------

  This script runs "apt-get update; apt-get upgrade" for a given
 Xen image.

  NOTE:  The image should not be mounted/live/running or things will
 be corrupted.  (Still if the image is "live" you may just use SSH, right?)



TODO
----

  1. Test more filesystem types.
  2. Move each file copying / creation into a seperate routine
  3. See if there can be simple tests made without splitting things
     into modules.
  4. Add progress indicators to long jobs.  How??
  5. Add --verbose.
