xen-create-image
----------------

  This is a simple script which is designed to create new images of 
 Debian Sarge which may be used with the Xen virtual machine.


TODO
----

  1. Test more filesystem types.
  2. Move each file copying / creation into a seperate routine
  3. See if there can be simple tests made without splitting things
     into modules.
  4. Add progress indicators to long jobs.  How??
  5. Add --verbose.
