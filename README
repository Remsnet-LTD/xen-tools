xen-tools
---------

  The xen-tools package contains a collection of Perl scripts for
 working with Xen guest images under Debian GNU/Linux.

  Using this software, you can easily create new Xen guests configured
 to be accessible over your local network and complete with an installed
 copy of OpenSSH.

  xen-tools currently has scripts to install all distributions of Debian
 and Ubuntu and some RPM-based distributions, however only the following
 are considered "supported":

	Debian:
	  * Etch 4.0
	  * Lenny 5.0
	  * Squeeze 6.0
	  * Sid

	Ubuntu:
	  * Hardy Heron 8.04 (see [1])
	  * Interpid Ibex 8.10
	  * Jaunty Jackaplope 9.04
	  * Karmic Koala 9.10
	  * Lucid Lynx 10.04 (see [2])

  [1] There is an issue with debootstrap on hardy not installing ksyslogd
      This can be fixed by chrooting into the newly installed system
      and removing the startup scripts. See:
      http://www.linux-vserver.org/Installing_Ubuntu_8.04_Hardy_as_guest

  [2] As of writing this 24.04.10, there is an issue with tar on
      Lucid with kernels < 2.6.22 this should however be patched right
      after release. See:
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tar/+bug/539814

  Older versions of ubuntu may work, however you will have to have to find
 a mirror that still hosts them. Currently the oldest Ubuntu Distribution
 on Canonical's archive.ubuntu.com is Hardy Heron.

Requirements
------------

  To use these tools you'll need the following software:

        * debootstrap
        * Perl
        * The Perl module "Text::Template"
        * The Perl module "Config::IniFiles"
          - Both of these modules are available as Debian packages,
            or direct from http://www.cpan.org/ for non-Debian distributions.
        * Make, if you are not installing through a package manager

  You can try to install RPM-based distributions such as CentOS, or
 Fedora Core you will need a correctly installed and configured
 "rinse" package. This is currently not supported.

  If you wish to create new Xen instances which may be controlled by
 users via a login shell you should also install the xen-shell package
 which is available from:

          http://xen-tools.org/software/xen-shell/



The Scripts
-----------

  There now follows a brief description of each included script,
 for more thorough documentation please consult the appropriate
 manpage.



xen-create-image
----------------

  This script is designed to create new images which may be used
 with the Xen hypervisor.

  The virtual images will have their networking settings created and,
 you may optionally cause the new instance to boot once it has
 been created.

  This script performs the initial setup, then delegates the real
 work to a collection of helper scripts:

    * xt-install-image
      Installs a distribution into a directory.

    * xt-customize-image
      Run a collection of hook scripts to configure the freshly 
      installed system.

    * xt-create-xen-config
      Create a configuration file in /etc/xen such that Xen can
      boot the newly created machine.


xen-create-nfs
--------------

  This script is similar in spirit to xen-create-image, but much
 less complex.  It allows the creation of Xen guests which are
 diskless, mounting their root filesystem over a remote NFS-share.

  There are not many options to tweak, but still a useful addition 
 to the suite.


xen-delete-image
----------------

  This script will allow you to completely remove Xen instances
 which have previously been created by xen-create-image, this
 includes removing the storage block devices from the system,
 and deleting the Xen configuration file.


xen-list-images
---------------

  List all the created images beneath a given root directory along
 with a brief overview of their setup details.


xen-update-image
----------------

  This script runs "apt-get update; apt-get upgrade" for a given
 Xen image.

  NOTES: 

  *  The image should not be running or corruption will occur!
  *  The script should only be used for Xen instances of Debian or
    a Debian-derived distribution.
