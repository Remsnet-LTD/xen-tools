xen-tools
---------

  The xen-tools package contains a collection of Perl scripts for
 working with Xen images under Debian GNU/Linux.

  It is aimed at users who wish to create virtual instances of Debian.
 You may easily manipulate instances of Debian Sarge, Etch, or Sid.

  There are two ways to use the scripts:

  1. With loopback files (simplest but slower).
  2. With LVM.


Loopback Files
--------------

  If you use the default setup with loopback files then each virtaul
 image will use two files on your host system:

	1. A disk image to be used by Xen as the primary drive.
	2. A disk image to be used by Xen as the swap partition.

  These images will be kept beneath whichever directory you specify 
 as your root directory (via the command line flag "--dir=.." or a 
 configuration file entry "dir = ..")

  Beneath the root directory each virtual instance will have a
 subdirectory, named after the hostname of the image.  

  A typical layout would look like this:

/home/xen/domains/
|-- bar               [Virtual machine named 'bar']
|   |-- disk.img        [Disk image]
|   `-- swap.img        [Swap image]
|-- etch              [Virtual machine named 'etch']
|   |-- disk.img        [Disk image]
|   `-- swap.img        [Swap image]



LVM Support
-----------

  If you wish to use the LVM support then you will give the 
 scripts an LVM device to store the images upon.

  In this case you'll have two new volumes created, one for
 the swap image and one for the disk storage.



xen-create-image
----------------

  This script is designed to create new images which may be used
 with the Xen virtual machine.  You may create images of Sarge, 
 Etch, or Sid.

  The virtual images will have their networking settings created and,
 you may optionally cause the new instance to boot once it has
 been created.

  The image may be customised by either hook scripts or a single
 role script - see the manpage for more details.

xen-clone-image
---------------

  This script allows a cloning operation to be conducted.  An existing
 image will be copied to a new directory and the networking information
 will be updated.  No other changes are applied.


xen-delete-image
----------------

  This script will delete an image by hostname.


xen-list-images
---------------

  List all the created images beneath a given root directory along
 with their network addresses.

  (In the case of images using DHCP an IP address will not be listed.)


xen-update-image
----------------

  This script runs "apt-get update; apt-get upgrade" for a given
 Xen image.

  NOTE:  The image should not be mounted/live/running or things will
 be corrupted.  (Still if the image is "live" you may just use SSH, right?)
