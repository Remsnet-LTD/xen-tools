xen-tools v0.4
--------------

  This archive contains a collection of Perl scripts for working with
 Xen images under Debian GNU/Linux.

  It is primarily aimed at people who wish to create instances of
 Debian Sarge, however 'Etch', and 'Sid' are also available.

  The tools all work in a similar way and each ahve the same assumptions.

  It is assumed that each virtual image will be comprised of two files
 upon the host system:  One for the primary drive, and one for the swap.
 The images are all assumed to live beneath the same root directory -
 this directory is an argument to all the scripts and may be set with
 '--dir=/path/to/root'.

  (Alternatively the directory may be included in the global configuration
 file.)

  The scripts are now described individually:



xen-create-image
----------------

  This is a simple script which is designed to create new images of 
 Debian Sarge which may be used with the Xen virtual machine.


xen-clone-image
---------------

  This allows a simple cloning operation to be conducted.  An existing
 image will be copied to a new directory and the networking information
 will be updated.  No other changes are applied.


xen-delete-image
----------------

  This script will delete an image by hostname.


xen-list-images
---------------

  List all the created images, along with the network address.
 (Or just 'DHCP' for dynamically configured images.)


xen-update-image
----------------

  This script runs "apt-get update; apt-get upgrade" for a given
 Xen image.

  NOTE:  The image should not be mounted/live/running or things will
 be corrupted.  (Still if the image is "live" you may just use SSH, right?)



TODO
----

  1. Test more filesystem types.
  2. Move each file copying / creation into a seperate routine.
  3. See if there can be simple tests made without splitting things
     into modules..
  4. Add --verbose.
  5. Detect and handle a failure in `debootstrap`.
  6. domU kernel to be moved to config file.
