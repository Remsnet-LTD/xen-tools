Minor bugs to fix and features to add before a 4.2 release
----------------------------------------------------------

* xen-create-image man page overhaul:

- ambiguous option list with regards to parameters

* Interactive Password Handling (maybe also the passwd role)

   Shouldn't give up after only one password missmatch. This is just
   a mater of wrapping the passwd call in a loop.

* Fix 70-install-ssh

   Currently 70-install-ssh fails to finish installing the ssh-server
   because it does not have a random seed to generate the host keys.
   Mounting /proc and /dev in chroot prior to calling the install
   function should fix this. If ssh-server is successfully installed
   in the domU, it's key fingerprint should be echo'd in a way that
   can easily be grep'ed into other scripts.

* Test and support more file system types.

   Actually this should be pretty simple now that the parameters are
   stored in the configuration hash.  The only issue is that trailing
   whitespace is missing from the "make_fs_foo" option.

* xen-create-image should check all integer options on non-digits.

* Test suite should pass

   Currently failing:

   t/getopt.t
   t/xen-delete-image.t
   t/xen-tools.t
   t/xt-create-xen-config.t

* Clean up setup-hostname - copying /etc/hosts isn't reliable

   One could argue that that this gives "extra" information to the domU, since
   the /etc/hosts file may contain more than just hosts on the same subnet.
   This should atleast be disabled via a flag.

* Setup locales in the hooks?

   Currently no locales are set and this causes several domU errors which appear
   in the domU's logs.

Maybe for a 4.3 or 5.0 release
------------------------------

* xen-create-image --dist=... / sources.list generation should be more fine-grained

   xen-tools should offer the possibility to enable/disable
   security/volatile/backports as well as
   contrib/non-free/universe/restricted/multiverse for each of them
   not only based on defaults plus the Dom0's sources.list

   One idea is to allow parameters like

   --dist="lenny:main,contrib,non-free;security;volatile:main"

   and maybe (if the default will be to include security) to also
   allow

   --dist="lenny;no-security"

   The second idea (by Mathieu Parent) is to have an
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/ which then contains files like
   lenny.list, lenny-server.list, karmic.list, etc. which defaults to
   $dist.list, but can be also select with --sources-list=lenny-server
   (which looks for ./lenny-server.list, ./lenny-server,
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/lenny-server.list and
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/lenny-server in that order).

   Third variant is to use /etc/xen-tools/sources.lists/ instead of
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/ because that directory is no
   runparts-like directory.

* LVM snapshot support as an install source.

* Clean up mounts on Ctrl-C, causes error while installing otherwise:

   Removing /dev/vg0/acromantula-domu1-disk - since we're forcing the install
   Can't remove open logical volume "acromantula-domu1-disk" this should be a
   matter of unmounting the mounted volume from /tmp.

* Non-Interactive Password Handling

   Option to generate passwords (check pwgen, apg, makepasswd, and
   gpw which of them are best suited for generating complete
   /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow lines). The password should be echo'ed
   after installation in a way that can be easily grep'ed into other
   scripts.

* Generic grub support

   This will generate a much nicer menu.lst as a side effect, as its currently
   generated once at install, and is never updated. Installing a full grub into
   the domU should update the menu.lst every time a new kernel is installed and
   will also use the domU distro's menu.lst conform.

* Move the hooks directory to /etc/xen-tools/ to officially allow
   added and modified hooks.

* Clean up the hooks directory

   Currently we have one directory for Ubuntu and Fedora named after
   the first supported release which is then duplicated for each
   subsequent release.

   I'm sure this won't scale forever. So to minimise code duplication
   I'd like to have one common directory per distribution (e.g. called
   ubuntu-common, fedora-common, debian-common, maybe even deb-common,
   rpm-common or yum-common for dpkg/apt-, rpm/yum-based
   distributions, etc.) with generic hooks valid for all or most of
   the releases of one distribution and then one hook directory per
   release (e.g. called ubuntu-10.04 or ubuntu-lucid or so) which has
   symbolic links to everything which can be used unchanged from the
   common directory and new files for everything which has to be
   different or only there.

* Create users, add ssh pubkeys to .ssh/authorized_keys

   Still have to think of a good way of doing this. It would be nice
   To specify a directory of public keys, parsing the hostnames
   parsing the usernames from the ssh comment line

* More generic hooks

   Deploy a web server or setup ssmtp directly via flag when setting up
   the machine. Open to suggestions, should just be some general use-cases
   that are fairly common.

* Sections for the xen-tools.conf file

   Currently it's really annoying when you are trying to create VMs
   on multiple subnets. It would be nice to specify with a flag what
   "type" of configuration you want, and a set of options specific to
   that flag could be parsed from xen-tools.conf

Stuff from Steve's TODO list / Generic TODOs
--------------------------------------------

* Write more test cases.

* xen-delete-image should unallocate any used IP addresses.
