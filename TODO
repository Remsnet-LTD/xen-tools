TODO
----

  1. Test and support more filesystem types.

  2. Write more test cases.  Problem: Many scripts require root access.

  3. If the new hostname is unqualified qualify it identically to the host?

  4. Update other scripts to use LVM properly.

  5. Test for valid LVM devices.

  6. Test more distributions with RPMStrap, instead of just centos4.
