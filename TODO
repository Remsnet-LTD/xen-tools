Bugs to fix and Features to add before a 4.2 release
----------------------------------------------------

* xen-create-image man page overhaul:

- ambiguous option list with regards to parameters

- talks about Sarge and Etch

* Test and support more file system types.

   Actually this should be pretty simple now that the parameters are
   stored in the configuration hash.  The only issue is that trailing
   whitespace is missing from the "make_fs_foo" option.

   At least --fs=xfs or ext4 doesn't work. Creates an ext3 anyway.

* debian/rules: Add a get-orig-source target

   It should probably call $(MAKE) orig-tar-gz

Maybe for a 4.3 or 5.0 release
------------------------------

* LVM snapshot support as an install source.

* Clean up mounts on Ctrl-C, causes error while installing otherwise:

   Removing /dev/vg0/acromantula-domu1-disk - since we're forcing the install
   Can't remove open logical volume "acromantula-domu1-disk"

* btsfs support

Stuff from Steve's TODO list / Generic TODOs
--------------------------------------------

* Write more test cases.

* xen-delete-image should unallocate any used IP addresses.
