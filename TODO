Minor bugs to fix and features to add before a 4.2 release
----------------------------------------------------------

* xen-create-image man page overhaul:

- ambiguous option list with regards to parameters
- Set Fail in more situations where the script has clearly failed
  i.e.: lvm exists

* Test and support more file system types.

   Actually this should be pretty simple now that the parameters are
   stored in the configuration hash.  The only issue is that trailing
   whitespace is missing from the "make_fs_foo" option.

* Setup locales in the hooks?

   Currently no locales are set and this causes several domU errors
   which appear in the domU's logs.

Maybe for a 4.3 or 5.0 release
------------------------------

* xen-create-image --dist=... / sources.list generation should be more fine-grained

   xen-tools should offer the possibility to enable/disable
   security/volatile/backports as well as
   contrib/non-free/universe/restricted/multiverse for each of them
   not only based on defaults plus the Dom0's sources.list

   One idea is to allow parameters like

   --dist="lenny:main,contrib,non-free;security;volatile:main"

   and maybe (if the default will be to include security) to also
   allow

   --dist="lenny;no-security"

   The second idea (by Mathieu Parent) is to have an
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/ which then contains files like
   lenny.list, lenny-server.list, karmic.list, etc. which defaults to
   $dist.list, but can be also select with --sources-list=lenny-server
   (which looks for ./lenny-server.list, ./lenny-server,
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/lenny-server.list and
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/lenny-server in that order).

   Third variant is to use /etc/xen-tools/sources.lists/ instead of
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/ because that directory is no
   runparts-like directory.

* LVM snapshot support as an install source.

* Clean up mounts on Ctrl-C, causes error while installing otherwise:

   Removing /dev/vg0/acromantula-domu1-disk - since we're forcing the
   install Can't remove open logical volume "acromantula-domu1-disk"
   this should be a matter of unmounting the mounted volume from /tmp.

* Generic grub support

   This will generate a much nicer menu.lst as a side effect, as its
   currently generated once at install, and is never updated. Installing
   a full grub into the domU should update the menu.lst every time a
   new kernel is installed and will also use the domU distro's menu.lst
   conform.

* pv-grub support

   This is a ways away and will probably start with a xen-pv-grub
   package.

* Move the hooks directory to /etc/xen-tools/ to officially allow
   added and modified hooks.

* Clean up the hooks directory

   Currently we have one directory for Ubuntu and Fedora named after
   the first supported release which is then duplicated for each
   subsequent release.

   I'm sure this won't scale forever. So to minimise code duplication
   I'd like to have one common directory per distribution (e.g. called
   ubuntu-common, fedora-common, debian-common, maybe even deb-common,
   rpm-common or yum-common for dpkg/apt-, rpm/yum-based
   distributions, etc.) with generic hooks valid for all or most of
   the releases of one distribution and then one hook directory per
   release (e.g. called ubuntu-10.04 or ubuntu-lucid or so) which has
   symbolic links to everything which can be used unchanged from the
   common directory and new files for everything which has to be
   different or only there.

* Create users, add ssh pubkeys to .ssh/authorized_keys

   Still have to think of a good way of doing this. It would be nice
   To specify a directory of public keys, parsing the hostnames
   parsing the usernames from the ssh comment line

* More generic roles

   Deploy a web server or setup ssmtp directly via flag when setting up
   the machine. Open to suggestions, should just be some general use-cases
   that are fairly common.

* Sections for the xen-tools.conf file

   Currently it's really annoying when you are trying to create VMs
   on multiple subnets. It would be nice to specify with a flag what
   "type" of configuration you want, and a set of options specific to
   that flag could be parsed from xen-tools.conf

* Refactor the code for less code duplication

   Like e.g. readConfigurationFile in xen-create-image and
   xen-resize-image which are not completely identical.

* Parse numerical parameters transparently for the user

   The user shouldn't have to know weather he should specify size
   as <size>G or <size>Gb or <size>. This should be parsed without
   user interaction and rely on a common format.

Stuff from Steve's TODO list / Generic TODOs
--------------------------------------------

* Write more test cases.

* xen-delete-image should unallocate any used IP addresses.
