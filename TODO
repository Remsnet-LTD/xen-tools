Bugs to fix and Features to add before a 4.2 release
----------------------------------------------------

* xen-create-image man page overhaul:

- ambiguous option list with regards to parameters

- talks about Sarge and Etch

* xen-create-image --dist=... / sources.list generation should be more fine-grained

   xen-tools should offer the possibility to enabled/disable
   security/volatile/backports as well as
   contrib/non-free/universe/restricted/multiverse for each of them
   not only based on defaults plus the Dom0's sources.list

   One idea is to allow parameters like

   --dist="lenny:main,contrib,non-free;security;volatile:main"

   and maybe (if the default will be to include security) to also
   allow

   --dist="lenny;no-security"

   The second idea (by Mathieu Parent) is to have an
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/ which then contains files like
   lenny.list, lenny-server.list, karmic.list, etc. which defaults to
   $dist.list, but can be also select with --sources-list=lenny-server
   (which looks for ./lenny-server.list, ./lenny-server,
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/lenny-server.list and
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/lenny-server in that order).

   Third variant is to use /etc/xen-tools/sources.lists/ instead of
   /etc/xen-tools/sources.list.d/ because that directory is no
   runparts-like directory.

* Test and support more file system types.

   Actually this should be pretty simple now that the parameters are
   stored in the configuration hash.  The only issue is that trailing
   whitespace is missing from the "make_fs_foo" option.

* Should check all integer expection options on other characters than digits.

* xen-create-image --bridge

   Currently specifiying a bridge is only possible, by editing the
   .cfg file by hand, after xen-create-image is done

* Test suite should pass

   Currently failing:

   t/getopt.t
   t/xen-delete-image.t
   t/xen-tools.t
   t/xt-create-xen-config.t

* Hooks

- Add reliable support for Ubuntu Hardy, Karmic and Lucid

- --passwd shouldn't give up after only one password missmatch

- Clean up setup-hostname - copying the dom0s /etc/hosts isn't reliable

- Setup locales in the hooks?


Maybe for a 4.3 or 5.0 release
------------------------------

* LVM snapshot support as an install source.

* Clean up mounts on Ctrl-C, causes error while installing otherwise:

   Removing /dev/vg0/acromantula-domu1-disk - since we're forcing the install
   Can't remove open logical volume "acromantula-domu1-disk"

* btrfs support

* Clean up the hooks directory

   Currently we have one directory for Ubuntu and Fedora named after
   the first supported release which is then duplicated for each
   subsequent release.

   I'm sure this won't scale forever. So to minimise code duplication
   I'd like to have one common directory per distribution (e.g. called
   ubuntu-common, fedora-common, etc.) with generic hooks valid for
   all or most of the releases of one distribution and then one hook
   directory per release (e.g. called ubuntu-10.04 or ubuntu-lucid or
   so) which has symbolic links to everything which can be used
   unchanged from the common directory and new files for everything
   which has to be different or only there.

* Create users, add ssh pubkeys to .ssh/authorized_keys

   Still have to think of a good way of doing this. It would be nice
   To specify a directory of public keys, parsing the hostnames
   parsing the usernames from the ssh comment line

* More generic hooks

   Deploy a web server or setup ssmtp directly via flag when setting up
   the machine. Open to suggestions, should just be simple applications

* Sections for the xen-tools.conf file

   Currently it's really annoying when you are trying to create VMs
   on multiple subnets. It would be nice to specify with a flag what
   "type" of configuration you want, and a set of options specific to
   that flag could be parsed from xen-tools.conf

Stuff from Steve's TODO list / Generic TODOs
--------------------------------------------

* Write more test cases.

* xen-delete-image should unallocate any used IP addresses.
