TODO
----

  1. Test and support more filesystem types.  Actually this should be
    pretty simple now that the parameters are stored in the configuration
    hash.  The only issue is that trailing whitespace is missing from the
    "make_fs_foo" option.

  2. Write more test cases.

  3. Test more distributions with RPMStrap, instead of just centos4.


  4. pointtopoint
