TODO
----

* Test and support more file system types.

   Actually this should be pretty simple now that the parameters are
   stored in the configuration hash.  The only issue is that trailing
   whitespace is missing from the "make_fs_foo" option.

* Write more test cases.

* LVM snapshot support as an install source.

* xen-delete-image should unallocate any used IP addresses.
