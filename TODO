Bugs to fix and Features to add before a 4.2 release
----------------------------------------------------

* Installs Etch by default. Should use Lenny or Squeeze instead of Etch.

* xen-create-image man page ambiguous with regards to parameters

* Test and support more file system types.

   Actually this should be pretty simple now that the parameters are
   stored in the configuration hash.  The only issue is that trailing
   whitespace is missing from the "make_fs_foo" option.

- Important: ext4

- Less important: btsfs

* debian/rules: Add a get-orig-source target

   It should probably call $(MAKE) orig-tar-gz

Maybe for a 4.3 or 5.0 release
------------------------------

* LVM snapshot support as an install source.

Stuff from Steve's TODO list / Generic TODOs
--------------------------------------------

* Write more test cases.

* xen-delete-image should unallocate any used IP addresses.
