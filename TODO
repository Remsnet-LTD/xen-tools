Bugs to fix and Features to add before a 4.2 release
----------------------------------------------------

* xen-create-image man page overhaul:

- ambiguous option list with regards to parameters

- talks about Sarge and Etch

* xen-create-image --dist=... should be more fine-grained

   It should over the possibility to enabled/disable
   security/volatile/backports as well as
   contrib/non-free/universe/restricted/multiverse for each of them.

   My current idea is to allow parameters like

   --dist="lenny:main,contrib,non-free;security;volatile:main"

   and maybe (if the default will be to include security) to also
   allow

   --dist="lenny;no-security"

* Test and support more file system types.

   Actually this should be pretty simple now that the parameters are
   stored in the configuration hash.  The only issue is that trailing
   whitespace is missing from the "make_fs_foo" option.

* Should check all integer expection options on other characters than digits.

Maybe for a 4.3 or 5.0 release
------------------------------

* LVM snapshot support as an install source.

* Clean up mounts on Ctrl-C, causes error while installing otherwise:

   Removing /dev/vg0/acromantula-domu1-disk - since we're forcing the install
   Can't remove open logical volume "acromantula-domu1-disk"

* btsfs support

Stuff from Steve's TODO list / Generic TODOs
--------------------------------------------

* Write more test cases.

* xen-delete-image should unallocate any used IP addresses.
