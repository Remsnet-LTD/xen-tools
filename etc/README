  This directory contains items to be installed in /etc/ upon installation.
  The contents are as follows:


1. xen-tools.conf
-----------------

  The global configuration file, read by all xen-* scripts.


2. hook.d/
----------

  The hook directory used by xen-create-image.  Each executable
 script in this directory will be run in turn as part of the creation
 of a new image.


3. role.d/
----------

  The role directory.

  If the xen-create-image script is invoked with the argument
 "--role foo" then the script "foo" in this directory will be
 executed as part of the image creation process.

  NOTE: Only one script will be executed.

  These scripts are designed to allow an image creator to have
 the ability to easily create different types of images, such
 as a "webserver", or a "mailserver".  By adding the relevent
 role to the commandline a basic image may be customized completely.
